# Book Recommendation System

**Brief**  
A lightweight ML project that delivers **personalized book recommendations** for an online reading platform. It cleans and explores public ratings data (e.g., goodbooks-10k), builds features, trains **collaborative filtering** (user-based, item-based, matrix factorization) with an optional **hybrid** layer using content (genres/authors), and serves results via a simple **web UI**. Evaluation uses **Precision@K**, **Recall@K**, and **RMSE** (for rating prediction).

## What this project helps with
- Reduces **choice overload** by showing a ranked shortlist tailored to each reader.  
- Increases **engagement & retention** through relevant suggestions.  
- Supports quick onboarding: users can enter a **user ID** or a few **favorite titles** to get instant recommendations.

## Deliverables
- Trained recommendation model + evaluation report  
- Lightweight **Streamlit** app for instant recommendations
